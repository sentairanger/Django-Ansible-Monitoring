# Django-Ansible-Monitoring
This expands upon the Django Dual Monitoring system by deploying it with Ansible. The original project is shown [here](https://github.com/sentairanger/Django-DualRobot-Monitoring). There is not much difference other than the fact that now Ansible can deploy our application across multiple hosts. This project is exactly like the Ansible Monitoring System that uses Flask. That project is posted [here](https://github.com/sentairanger/Ansible-Robot-Monitoring).
